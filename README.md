I will be honest, I do not understand much of what is going on in the break file, since it has no commenting and I am still unfamiliar with js/ts in general.  
Some things I noticed:
•	Break file imported a lot more directories that seemed very specific
•	Break file made a lot of specific references to RPC that were not present in hello world
•	Break file was not making and greeting accounts 
•	Break file used a lot more react (because of the frontend UI?)
•	Break file had a loop for retrying a failed transaction (I think)
•	There were a couple nests of text that looked like they were reused 3 or 4 times, but I couldn’t distinguish between them and how they were doing different things in the code
